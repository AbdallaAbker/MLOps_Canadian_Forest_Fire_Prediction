## Welcome to my MLOps Zoomcamp Project :wave:

Project: MLOps Zoomcamp - Canadian Forest Fire Prediction

The task is to predict the risk of forest fires in various provinces of Canada based on environmental and geographical factors. The problem is a multi-class classification problem where the target variable has four categories: No Fire, Low Risk, Medium Risk, and High Risk. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the fire risk level given the feature inputs.

This project focuses less on experimentation and more on illustrating various tools and practices in MLOps.
